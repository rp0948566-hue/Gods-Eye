"""Time validity primitives — chain_majority_time, drift tolerance,
phase boundaries.

Source of truth: ``infonet-economy/RULES_SKELETON.md`` §3.13, §3.14.

Three rules:

1. **Reject future events beyond drift tolerance** — an event whose
   ``timestamp`` exceeds ``chain_majority_time() + max_future_event_drift_sec``
   is rejected. Defends against clock skew or manipulation.

2. **Reject stale events past finalized phase boundaries** — an
   ``evidence_submit`` after the evidence window has closed, or a
   ``resolution_stake`` after the resolution window has closed, is
   rejected. (The phase-boundary check itself lives in Sprint 4 with
   the market lifecycle; this module exposes the building blocks.)

3. **Phase transitions use majority-accepted chain time** — no single
   node's local clock can unilaterally trigger or delay a transition.

Cross-cutting design rule (BUILD_LOG.md): time validity checks must
NEVER block a user's UI. The intended caller flow:

- Receiver-side ingest: events that fail drift tolerance are silently
  re-queued for retry. The user does not see a 4xx.
- Producer-side append: if the local clock is too far ahead, the
  producer adjusts its clock or back-pressures, but the user's queued
  action is NOT lost.

This module is pure logic — the queue / retry behavior is the caller's
responsibility.
